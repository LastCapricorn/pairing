>My solution works fine in 'Chrome' and 'Opera'
>Looking bad in 'Firefox' and 'CLIQZ'
>doesn't work with 'IE' and 'Edge'
>
>...everyone's doing his own thing...
>I don't like that much.

>If my 'terrible' code is okay for 'Chrome', it should also be with the other ones.
>Doing ONE job three times in three different ways? Why?
>
>I've done this, without pairing, but paired with some older development-experiments of mine...
